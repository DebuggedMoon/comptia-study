## Development
<!-- TODO: Remake this section, It's ugly! Have the catogries be sub headers and use images for each technology. Try making it look more interessting :D -->
I am still fairly new to NextJS, so my conventions may be off and not following best practice.
### File Structure Conventions
 - All the source code is stored within the `./src` directory
 - Images and static assets are stored in the `./public` directory
 - NextJS Server actions and DB related files are in the `./src/services` directory
 - Components and their files follow the `PascalCase` naming convention

### Technologies Used
